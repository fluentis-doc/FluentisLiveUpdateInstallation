Let's proceed to see the minimum system requirements for installing **Fluentis Web**.

### Server Side Requirements

The recommended requirements for the server are to have a virtual machine with 3 Gigabytes of RAM per user with a minimum of 16 Gigabytes.  
This configuration allows optimal distribution of the workload while avoiding taking resources away from the Wpf part.  
***You can use a Windows Server virtual machine or Ubuntu Server***

Recommended client-side requirements are:  
**Mozilla Firefox** at the latest available version.  

You can use an operating system that is compatible with Mozilla Firefox, for example Linux Distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, ecc...), MacOs, Windows.
