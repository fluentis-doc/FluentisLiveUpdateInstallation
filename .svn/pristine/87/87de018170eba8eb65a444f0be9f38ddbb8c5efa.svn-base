The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network.  
FTP is built on a clientâ€“server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server.  
FTP Server is really useful for transferring files from local pc to remote server. Using an FTP client, you can graphically view the ubuntu file system and move files between folders.  


#### How it works

Install FTP Daemon by command below:

```bash
sudo apt install vsftpd
```

You can manage the service via systemctl:  

```bash
sudo systemctl status vsftpd
```

You can use two types of authentication: 
* Anonymous FTP Configuration
* User Authenticated FTP Configuration

For FTP Configuration, open vsftpd.conf by command below:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
```

For more information visit the official Canonical Ubuntu documentation about VSFTPD
