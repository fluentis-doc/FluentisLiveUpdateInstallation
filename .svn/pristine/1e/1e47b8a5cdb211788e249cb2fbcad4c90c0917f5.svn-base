1.  Update the system packages to their latest version by this command.

``` bash 
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

2.	Import Microsoft GPG Key for ensure authenticity of the packages weâ€™ll be downloading.

``` bash
curl -fsSL https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/microsoft-prod.gpg
```

1. If you see a public key unavailable warning, you can use the following command:

``` bash 
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.asc
```
4.	Manually download and register the SQL Server Ubuntu repository:

``` bash
curl -fsSL https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/22.04/mssql-server-2022.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-server-2022.list
```
5.	And finally.

``` bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mssql-server
```

6.	Configure Microsoft SQL Server 2022 and choose the edition.
``` bash 
sudo /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf setup
```
