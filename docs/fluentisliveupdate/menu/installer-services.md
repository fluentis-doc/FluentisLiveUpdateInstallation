In this page are listed all the active/current Fluentis Installers registrations. For each installer there is server with which it can communicate.

You just have to insert a new row with the **server name**, the **api key** (which at that the moment you will only get within Fluentis Installer installation on Ubuntu and Photon distributions) and then save it with the green floppy icon, placed on the top right corner of the page. 

The version column will automatically populate after the registration is finalized.
